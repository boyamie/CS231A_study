examine properties of projective transformations. We define a camera
coordinate system, which is only rotated and translated from a world coordinate system.
(a) Prove that parallel lines in the world reference system are still parallel in the camera reference
system. [4 points]
(b) Consider a unit square pqrs in the world reference system where p, q, r, and s are points. Will
the same square in the camera reference system always have unit area? Prove or provide a
counterexample. [4 points]

(c) Now letâ€™s consider affine transformations, which are any transformations that preserve parallelism. Affine transformations include not only rotations and translations, but also scaling
and shearing. Given some vector p, an affine transformation is defined as
A(p) = M p + b
where M is an invertible matrix. Prove that under any affine transformation, the ratio of
parallel line segments is invariant, but the ratio of non-parallel line segments is not invariant.

(d) You have explored whether these three properties hold for affine transformations. Do these
properties hold under any projective transformation? Justify briefly in one or two sentences
(no proof needed). [6 points]
